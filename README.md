This is the code for Assignment 1 of CS622 : Advanced Computer Architecture.

Problem 1 : A Cache Simulator that simulates L2 and L3 cache in an inclusive, exclusive and NINE hierarchy.

Problem 2: Comparing LRU and Belady's MIN for a set associative L2 and inclusive, fully associative L3 cache and calculating cold, capacity and conflict misses.
